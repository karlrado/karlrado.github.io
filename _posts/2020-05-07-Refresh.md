Since it had been months since I first set up this blog, I had forgotten how it works and how to update it, etc.

### Useful References

* [Minimal Mistakes GitHub Pages Site Starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter)  This is how I started this site by forking it.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) The home page for this static site generator.
* [Jekyll GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) A useful page from the Jekyll site.

### How to Make a Post

Just add a file to the `_posts` folder named with the same file naming convention as the rest and push to GitHub.
GitHub will publish the site within a few minutes.

### Local Preview

If I make changes on my home machine which has already been set up with all the various Ruby tools, I can just say:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

And it starts a webserver that I can browse to in order to see what it looks like before pushing to GitHub.

Be sure to run this command from the top of the repo.
