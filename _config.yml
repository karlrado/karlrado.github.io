# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Repository
# I need to set this here in order to do local builds of the site because I am
# using an alias of "github.com-karlrado" instead of "github.com" in my local setting
# for the "origin" remote.  I specify this alias as a Host in my SSH config file,
# which allows me to specify a specific SSH key for this GitHub account.
# Apparently jekyll looks at my remote "origin" value and can't do anything
# with it because it contains this alias.
# Otherwise, I'd have to set the PAGES_REPO_NWO environment variable whenever
# serving the page locally.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
